BUG:

1: When access settings page, the page keeps loading, 
some problem with cache, the spinner never changes his status, 
when refresh page it works correctly.

2: There is a bug when updating a user picure, it needs a aditional
"/" right after the unique folder creation, so the file get a 404, becouse of that.


3: Also related to bug number two, check if the image is successfully uploaded
with correct path, if the navbar imediately updates the user's nwe photo.
